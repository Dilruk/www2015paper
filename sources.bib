abstract = {Microblog is becoming more and more popular in people's daily life, through which people can read and send short text messages. Considering millions of data posted every day, detecting bursty topic in real-time will be helpful for people to grasp central information. In this paper we propose a novel bursty topic detection technique based on an improved method by calculating term weight, the calculating method we used takes user weight and the number of listeners, replies and collections into account. We first use a novel aging theory to model a term life cycle, then calculate user weight through improved PageRank algorithm to express term weight, at last adopt a unsupervised learning algorithm to detect bursty topic, meanwhile provide the results and evaluation in contrast with TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) and UF-ITUF (user frequency-inverse thread user frequency) model to prove the validity of our proposed approach.},

abstract = {Twitter is a very popular online social networking and micro-blogging service that enables its users to post and share text-based messages called tweets. The numbers of active users and tweets generated daily are enormous and hence they, collectively, can give crucial clues to several interesting problems such as public opinion analysis and hot trend detection. Especially, to find out hot issues and trends from tweets, detection of popular keywords is very important. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for detecting trend and bursty keywords from Twitter stream data. Our scheme is very robust in that it can handle typical usages such as various abbreviations, minor typing errors and spacing errors that occur very frequently when writing tweets on various mobile devices. We implemented a prototype system and performed various experiments to show the effectiveness of our scheme. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@inproceedings{weng2011event,
abstract = {Twitter, as a form of social media, is fast emerging in recent years. Users are using Twitter to report real-life events. This paper focuses on detecting those events by analyzing the text stream in Twitter. Although event detection has long been a research topic, the characteristics of Twitter make it a non-trivial task. Tweets reporting such events are usually overwhelmed by high flood of meaningless “babbles”. Moreover, event detection algorithm needs to be scalable given the sheer amount of tweets. This paper attempts to tackle these challenges with EDCoW (Event Detection with Clustering of Wavelet-based Signals). EDCoW builds signals for individual words by applying wavelet analysis on the frequencybased raw signals of the words. It then filters away the trivial words by looking at their corresponding signal autocorrelations. The remaining words are then clustered to form events with a modularity-based graph partitioning technique. Experimental results show promising result of EDCoW.},
